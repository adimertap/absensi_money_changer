# Money Changer Cashier web Application

Money Changer web application is an application that supports all money exchange transactions at PT. Riastavalasindo. I am a Full-Stack Web Developer in developing this application starting from business processes, database design and code implementation. 

This application is built based on the problem of the money changer shop client still using the process of recording transactions manually and there are many obstacles from the manual system. The solution to the problem given is the creation of a web-based cashier application for PT Riastavalasindo.

Initially appeared on
[gist](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2). But the page cannot open anymore so that is why I have moved it here.

## Feature
- Login and Master Data Management (Employees and Currency).
- The Main Process is Cashier Transactions.-
- Cashier Capital Management Every Day by Employees.
- Journalizing Debit and Credit Transactions.
- Reporting All Transactions, Daily and Monthly.
- Excel, Pdf Download and Print Notes.

## Development

The first step in application design is research, design thinking and business process design. The research is carried out by discussing with clients, the results of the research are business processes that are in accordance with standard operating procedures for cashiers.

There are 2 (two) roles in the application that have been created, including the Owner Role who works in managing all master data business processes and transaction reporting, the second is the Employee Role which functions to record all daily transactions that occur at money changers.

### Tech Stack & Testing
Tech stack in application design which includes MySQL for databases, Laravel 8 Framework, Front-End HTML and CSS (Bootstrap 5), Backend PHP and Javascript. Business process design tools include Notion and Visual Studio Code for code implementation. The application has been tested and is running normally until now.

### Database
Database design is carried out on the MySQL application which is described in the form of PDM or Physical Data Model. PDM which was built as a guide in making Cashier Applications consisting of 6 entitas (table).
